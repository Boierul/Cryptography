Why OTP is theoretically unbreakable:

OTP stands for "One-Time Password". It is a password that is valid for only one login session or transaction,
and it is used to provide an additional layer of security to online services and transactions.

OTP is theoretically unbreakable because it relies on a unique and random password that is generated for each login session or transaction.
This password is not reused and is only valid for a short period of time, typically a few minutes.

OTP is generated using cryptographic algorithms that are designed to ensure that the password is unpredictable and can only be
generated by the authorized user or device. The key to generating the OTP is a shared secret key, which is known only to the
user and the authentication server or device.

Since the OTP password is generated using a unique and unpredictable algorithm and is valid for only a short period of time,
it is very difficult for an attacker to guess or intercept the password. Even if an attacker were to obtain the OTP code,
it would be useless for subsequent login sessions or transactions, as the code would have already expired.

However, it's worth noting that OTP systems can be vulnerable to attacks if the shared secret key is compromised or if the
device generating the OTP is compromised. Therefore, it's important to ensure that the OTP system is implemented and
managed securely to ensure its effectiveness.

Requirements for OTP systems to be secure:
 - Key stream used only once
 - Key stream is unpredictable
 - Key stream is only known to the user and the authentication server or device
 - Key stream is not stored on the authentication server or device
 - Key stream us generated using a secure algorithm and used only true random numbers

OTP example algorithms:
    - HMAC-based One-Time Password Algorithm (HOTP)
    - Time-based One-Time Password Algorithm (TOTP)
    - Secure Remote Password (SRP)
