Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange algorithm used in cryptography to securely exchange cryptographic keys over a
public communication channel.

The basic idea behind the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is that two parties, let's call them Alice and Bob,
can agree on a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel without actually exchanging
the key itself. Instead, they each choose a secret number and use a mathematical formula to generate a
public key based on their secret number. They then exchange these public keys, and use another mathematical
formula to derive the shared secret key from the other party's public key and their own secret key.

The security of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms
in a finite field. Essentially, an attacker who intercepts the public keys exchanged by Alice and Bob
would need to solve a hard mathematical problem in order to calculate the shared secret key.

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is used in many cryptographic protocols, including SSL/TLS for secure web communication,
and in the creation of VPN tunnels for secure remote access.
