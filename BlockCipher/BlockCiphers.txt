Block ciphers are a type of symmetric-key encryption algorithm that operate on fixed-size blocks of data,
typically 64 or 128 bits. The input block is encrypted or decrypted using a fixed-length key, resulting in an output block of the same size.

Block ciphers can be classified into two categories: Feistel ciphers and substitution-permutation ciphers.

Feistel ciphers use a combination of substitution and permutation operations on each block of plaintext
to produce ciphertext.
 - DES (Data Encryption Standard)
 - 2DES (Double DES)
 - 3DES (Triple DES)

Substitution-permutation ciphers use a combination of substitution and permutation operations on each block
of plaintext to produce ciphertext.
 - AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

Other notorious block ciphers:
    - IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm)
    - TwoFish (Twofish is a symmetric-key block cipher)
    - Blowfish (Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher)
    - Serpent (Serpent is a symmetric-key block cipher)
    - GOST (GOST/Magma is a russian symmetric-key block cipher)
