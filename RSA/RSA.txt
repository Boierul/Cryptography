RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key (asymmetric) cryptographic algorithm used for encryption and digital signatures.

The RSA algorithm is based on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers. It involves the generation of a public
and private key pair. The public key can be freely distributed to anyone, while the private key must be kept secret.

The encryption process using RSA involves converting the message into a numerical value, and then encrypting it using
the recipient's public key. The recipient can then use their private key to decrypt the message and recover the original plaintext.

The digital signature process using RSA involves applying a mathematical function to the message using the sender's
private key, which generates a digital signature. The recipient can then verify the signature using the sender's
public key, ensuring that the message was indeed sent by the claimed sender and has not been tampered with.

The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. This means
that breaking RSA encryption or forging RSA digital signatures requires the ability to factor very large numbers,
which is currently believed to be infeasible for sufficiently large keys.

RSA is widely used in many applications, including secure email communication, SSL/TLS for secure web communication,
and digital signatures for electronic transactions.
