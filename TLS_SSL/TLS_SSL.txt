TLS (Transport Layer Security) and its predecessor SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are cryptographic protocols used to
establish secure communication between two systems over a network, such as the internet.

TLS/SSL works by creating a secure channel between the two systems, which can be used to transmit data securely.
This is accomplished by using a combination of symmetric-key cryptography (which uses the same key for encryption
and decryption) and public-key cryptography (which uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption).

TLS/SSL provides three main security features:
    - Authentication: The server and client must authenticate each other before they can communicate securely.
    - Integrity: The data being transmitted must not be modified in transit.
    - Confidentiality(Encryption): The data being transmitted must not be readable by anyone other than the intended recipient.
